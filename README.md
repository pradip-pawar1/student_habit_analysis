# Student Habit VS Academic Performance Analysis

## ✅ Project Overview

This is a real-life data analysis project focused on **students' study habits, daily routines, and performance patterns**.  
I collected and analyzed practical data to understand how habits impact productivity.

## ✅ Key Highlights

- **Self-collected dataset**: 16 columns, 1000 rows, realistic student performance data.
- Full **Jupyter Notebook** with clear code, charts, and human-style insights.
- Honest storytelling — each chart explained in simple words, not just raw numbers.
- Highlights real triggers, peak study hours, and gaps that students can improve.

## ✅ Files Included

- `student_habit_analysis.ipynb` — Main notebook with code, plots, and insights.
- `student_habits_performance.csv` — The dataset.
- `Student habit insights.pptx` — Visual insights of project
- `README.md` — Information about project 

## ✅ What I Learned

- Turning raw CSV data into clear insights.
- EDA using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
- Translating data into a story that makes sense to humans.
- Identifying gaps and peak patterns from real-life habits.

## ✅ Tools Used

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## ✅ Next Steps

- Expand this project with more student samples.
- Publish my work on Kaggle & GitHub as part of my real-world portfolio.
